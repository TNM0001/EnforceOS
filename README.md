  <h2 align="center">The EOS-Project</h2>

  The EOS-Project is a collection of websites/programs made to show the power of one, still-learning, developer.

  https://home.tnm.lol is the "home" of the EOS-Project, designed as a calculator with hidden codes hardcoded which executes different things like redirects or Easter Eggs.
  The following are secret codes hardcoded into the calculator:
  7530= will redirect you to here. (tnm.lol)
  8008= will display one of the 8 pictures of NSFW as art.
  9012= will redirect you to https://nsfw.tnm.lol which is defined below.
  
  https://nsfw.tnm.lol is the 18+ only website hosting NSFW content as art, think of it like a museum or sort of an internet archive.
